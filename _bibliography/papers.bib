  abstract        = {In this paper, we explore an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system with backscattering RFID tags. In this setup, an access point employs a communication beam to serve a user while leveraging a sensing beam to detect an RFID tag. Under the total transmit power constraint of the system, our objective is to design sensing and communication beams by considering the tag detection and communication requirements. First, we adopt zero-forcing to design the beamforming vectors, followed by solving a convex optimization problem to determine the power allocation between sensing and communication. Then, we study a joint beamforming design problem with the goal of minimizing the total transmit power while satisfying the tag detection and communication requirements. To resolve this, we re-formulate the non-convex constraints into convex second-order cone constraints. The simulation results demonstrate that, under different communication SINR requirements, joint beamforming optimization outperforms the zero-forcing-based method in terms of achievable detection distance, offering a promising approach for the ISAC-backscattering systems.},

  abstract        = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, with their large number of antennas, offer an interesting opportunity for high spatial-resolution imaging. In this paper, we propose a novel RIS-aided integrated imaging and communication system that can reduce the RIS beam training overhead for communication by leveraging the imaging of the surrounding environment. In particular, using the RIS as a wireless imaging device, our system constructs the scene depth map of the environment, including the mobile user. Then, we develop a user detection algorithm that subtracts the background and extracts the mobile user attributes from the depth map. These attributes are then utilized to design the RIS interaction vector and the beam selection strategy with low overhead. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can achieve comparable beamforming gain to the optimal/exhaustive beam selection solution while requiring 1000 times less beam training overhead.},

  abstract        = {Utilizing radar sensing for assisting communication has attracted increasing interest thanks to its potential in dynamic environments. A particularly interesting problem for this approach appears in the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) millimeter wave and terahertz communication scenarios, where the narrow beams change with the movement of both vehicles. To address this problem, in this work, we develop a radar-aided beam-tracking framework, where a single initial beam and a set of radar measurements over a period of time are utilized to predict the future beams after this time duration. Within this framework, we develop two approaches with the combination of various degrees of radar signal processing and machine learning. To evaluate the feasibility of the solutions in a realistic scenario, we test their performance on a real-world V2V dataset. Our results indicated the importance of high angular resolution radar for this task and affirmed the potential of using radar for the V2V beam management problems.},

  abstract        = {Current scene depth estimation approaches mainly rely on optical sensing, which carries privacy concerns and suffers from estimation ambiguity for distant, shiny, and transparent surfaces/objects. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) provide a path for employing a massive number of antennas using low-cost and energy-efficient architectures. This has the potential for realizing RIS-aided wireless sensing with high spatial resolution. In this paper, we propose to employ RIS-aided wireless sensing systems for scene depth estimation. We develop a comprehensive framework for building accurate depth maps using RIS-aided mmWave sensing systems. In this framework, we propose a new RIS interaction codebook capable of creating a sensing grid of reflected beams that meets the desirable characteristics of efficient scene depth map construction. Using the designed codebook, the received signals are processed to build high-resolution depth maps. Simulation results compare the proposed solution against RGB-based approaches and highlight the promise of adopting RIS-aided mmWave sensing in scene depth perception.},

  abstract        = {With the development of telecommunication technologies and the proliferation of network applications in the past decades, the traditional cloud network architecture becomes unable to accommodate such demands due to the heavy burden on the backhaul links and long latency. Therefore, edge computing, which brings network functions close to end-users by providing caching, computing and communication resources at network edges, turns into a promising paradigm. Benefit from its nature, edge computing enables emerging scenarios and use cases, such as augmented reality (AR) and Internet of Things (IowT). However, it also creates complexities to efficiently orchestrate heterogeneous services and manage distributed resources in the edge network. In this survey, we make a comprehensive review of the research efforts on service orchestration and resource management for edge computing. We first give an overview of edge computing, including architectures, advantages, enabling technologies and standardization. Next, a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art techniques in the management and orchestration of edge computing is presented. Subsequently, the state-of-the-art research on the infrastructure of edge computing is discussed in various aspects. Finally, open research challenges and future directions are presented as well.},

  author          = {Luo, Hao and Wei, Hung-Yu},
  abstract        = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) is a crucial component in 5G and beyond 5G communications. However, the dense deployment of mmWave transceivers would impose a heavy burden on the management of the radio access network (RAN). This challenge increases the need for leveraging intelligent network management techniques. Thanks to edge computing, machine learning (ML) based network management algorithms and other delay-sensitive user applications can operate at the network edge. But, due to the limited resources on edge servers, developing an orchestration scheme for intelligent network management and user applications is necessary. In this paper, we provide an edge-centric resource management framework for intelligent RAN management and applications with the awareness of the usersâ€™ quality of experiences (QoE). Specifically, we consider the scenario of a mmWave communication system equipped with an ML-based mmWave beam tracking algorithm. The users under this system request mobile edge gaming services. We formulate a game QoE aware orchestration problem as a non-linear integer programming and prove its NP-hardness. To reduce the complexity, we decompose the original problem into two subproblems, the service placement problem for mobile edge gaming and the configuration selection and placement problem for mmWave beam tracking. Then, we solve the two subproblems consecutively with heuristic approaches. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed orchestration scheme.},

  abstract={Background: Timely and accurate outcome prediction plays a vital role in guiding clinical decisions on acute ischemic stroke. Early condition deterioration and severity after the acute stage are determinants for long-term outcomes. Therefore, predicting early outcomes is crucial in acute stroke management. However, interpreting the predictions and transforming them into clinically explainable concepts are as important as the predictions themselves.
  Objective: This work focused on machine learning model analysis in predicting the early outcomes of ischemic stroke and used model explanation skills in interpreting the results.},

  author={Huang, Wen-Chin and Luo, Hao and Hwang, Hsin-Te and Lo, Chen-Chou and Peng, Yu-Huai and Tsao, Yu and Wang, Hsin-Min},
  abstract={An effective approach for voice conversion (VC) is to disentangle linguistic content from other components in the speech signal. The effectiveness of variational autoencoder (VAE) based VC (VAE-VC), for instance, strongly relies on this principle. In our prior work, we proposed a cross-domain VAE-VC (CDVAE-VC) framework, which utilized acoustic features of different properties, to improve the performance of VAE-VC. We believed that the success came from more disentangled latent representations. In this article, we extend the CDVAE-VC framework by incorporating the concept of adversarial learning, in order to further increase the degree of disentanglement, thereby improving the quality and similarity of converted speech. More specifically, we first investigate the effectiveness of incorporating the generative adversarial networks (GANs) with CDVAE-VC. Then, we consider the concept of domain adversarial training and add an explicit constraint to the latent representation, realized by a speaker classifier, to explicitly eliminate the speaker information that resides in the latent code. Experimental results confirm that the degree of disentanglement of the learned latent representation can be enhanced by both GANs and the speaker classifier. Meanwhile, subjective evaluation results in terms of quality and similarity scores demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.},
