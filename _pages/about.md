Hi there! I'm a fourth-year PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Arizona State University, where I work with Prof. [Ahmed Alkhateeb](https://www.aalkhateeb.net){:target="\_blank"} in the [Wireless Intelligence Lab](https://www.wi-lab.net){:target="\_blank"}.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degress in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University, the latter under the supervision of Prof. [Hung-Yu Wei](http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~hywei/){:target="\_blank"}. From Jul. 2018 to Feb. 2020, I interned at Institute of Information Science in Academia Sinica with advisor Prof. [Hsin-Min Wang](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/whm/){:target="\_blank"}.

My research interests include wireless communication, wireless sensing, machine learning, and edge computing. Currently, I am working on digital twin aided MIMO communications.

I am also a big fan of [Phoenix Suns](https://www.instagram.com/suns/?hl=en){:target="\_blank"}. Let's go Suns!
